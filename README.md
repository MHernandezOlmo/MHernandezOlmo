## About

I design and build scalable interactive systems across XR, mobile, and gameplay environments.

My work focuses on:

- Modular gameplay architectures
- Service-oriented system design
- Strict separation of concerns
- Deterministic combat and progression frameworks
- Reusable Unity editor tooling
- Native mobile engineering (Kotlin / Swift)

I build systems — not just features.
